        Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily<br>
        You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks<br>
        Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)<br>
        And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself<br>
        I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped<br>
        Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl<br>
        <br>

     <p2 class="p2">
        Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy<br>
        Not me, if you ever cared to ask<br>
        Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby<br>
        God, I wish that I could do that<br>
        I've lost my mind, I've spent the night<br>
        Crying on the floor of my bathroom<br>
        But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it<br>
        But I guess good for you<br>
        <br>

        Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want (ah)<br>
        You bought a new car and your career's really taking off (ah)<br>
        It's like we never even happened<br>
        Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ha)<br>
        And good for you, it's like you never even met me<br>
        Remember when you swore to God I was the only<br>
        Person who ever got you?<br>
        Well, screw that and screw you<br>
        You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do<br>
        <br>

        Maybe I'm too emotional<br>
        But your apathy is like a wound in salt<br>
        Maybe I'm too emotional<br>
        Or maybe you never cared at all<br>
        Maybe I'm too emotional<br>
        Your apathy is like a wound in salt<br>

        Like a damn sociopath!<br>
