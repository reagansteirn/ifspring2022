        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Hello! My name is Reagan Steirn and I'm a junior studying comdes!</p>
        <p>2. My background consists of graphic design as well as fine arts. I am taking this course because it is a requirement for my major, but I am really excited to learn something new.</p>
       <p>3. I have no CS experience :(</p> 
       <p>4. I want to learn more about the components of making a website and how to design one.</p> 
        <p>5. I have designed for both print and screen and know that scale and color look different on screen rather than off.</p>
        <p>6. I feel that this website <a href="https://fontsinuse.com"> Fonts In Use</a> exemplifies effective design due to the aesthetic, but also the way the tabs are formulated. I also really enjoy the layout of the home page.</p>
        <p>7. This website <a href="https://oa.letterformarchive.org"> Letterform Archive</a> exemplifies effective communication due to the layout as well as the navigation bar. The website is super straight forward and easy to read.</p>
  <p>8. I think that this website <a href="https://triborodesign.com"> Triboro Design </a> works very well due to how simple it is. The way the user can navigate by scrolling down as well as simply clicking each image is very user friendly and easy.</p>
